If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


4)How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
  I helped divide the game's functionality such that porting it to different operating systems would need less time and effort. all while maintaining the same game. Even though your customer may have asked you to do the task, the product is really under the ultimate control of its users. They won't utilize it and won't buy any more products if they don't trust the software or have issues with it.

5)How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
